## Technologies Used

The Coding Assistant Bot is built using the following technologies:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime environment
- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications
- **OpenAI API**: For generating code and responses
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- **File System (fs)**: For file operations

- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate high-quality code based on user prompts.
- **Comprehensive File Management**: Supports various file operations such as generating, editing, deleting, renaming, copying, and moving files.
- **Project Setup**: Can set up new projects for popular frameworks like NestJS and React.
- **Code Review**: Provides detailed code reviews, covering aspects like structure, naming conventions, and potential improvements.
- **CLI Interface**: Easy-to-use command-line interface for interacting with the bot.
- **Start and Stop**: Easily start the application with `npm start` and stop it by typing `@stop` in the terminal.
- **Colored Terminal Output**: Uses `colorette` to provide colored output in the terminal for better readability and user experience.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling to provide more informative and user-friendly error messages.
- **Support for More Frameworks**: Extend support to additional frameworks and languages.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Integrate with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication and authorization to secure the bot's functionalities.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based interface for users who prefer a graphical user interface over the CLI.
- **Memory and Context Awareness**: Implement memory and context awareness to provide more personalized and contextually relevant responses.
